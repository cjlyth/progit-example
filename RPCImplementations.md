A number of people are working on RPC systems based on protobuf.  ZeroC's [Ice](http://zeroc.com/ice.html) now supports [encoding messages using Protocol Buffers](http://www.zeroc.com/labs/protobuf/index.html), though it requires defining RPC services in a separate file and language, not `.proto`-style RPC definitions.  There are also some experimental implementations of pure-protobuf RPC.  Note that none of these projects are officially affiliated with or endorsed by Google; try them at your own risk.
